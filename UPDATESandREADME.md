# snake-game

First project — modifying a snake game developed from code found online.

Online code provided the following:
- Opens a program where an apple and a moveable snake exists on a 2D grid
- Arrow keys move the snake (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN)
- When the snakes head collides into the apple, a displayed scoreboard has its score incremented
- Apple then randomly gets placed again and snake length increases by one unit
- Snake colour is fixed to green, and apple to red
- Upon collision or moving the snake into the borders of the program frame, a game over screen appears stating your score

PLANS FOR MODIFICATION
- Fix existing bug: Snake self-collides after pressing two buttons simultaneously given a direction and length
- Plan to add a option to restart/replay the game
- Add more apples with varying effects
- Add a title screen and several game modes

UPDATE 1
- Additional and unique green apple that doubles your total snake length and score
- Modified the green apple to randomly appear/disappear upon consuming a red apple
